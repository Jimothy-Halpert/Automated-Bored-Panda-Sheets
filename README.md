# Setting up googlesheets automated scripts for your computer

Firstly, we begin by downloading .exe and .rar from the [url provided](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1pBiYn5Z63lO3IkibCzZcv7rCen5pG_cl?usp=sharing), then we save those files to some directory in the computer and unzip .rar files.

When the previous step has been executed, we proceed to set up the task scheduler:

1. Type "Task Scheduler" in the search bar and press enter
2. Find "Create a new task" on the right and click on it
